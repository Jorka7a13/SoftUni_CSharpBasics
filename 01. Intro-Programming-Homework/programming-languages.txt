1.Java
Like C#, Java is class-based, object-oriented computer programming language.
It is specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible, 
meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another. 
It's used particularly for client-server web applications.

2.C++
C++ is imperative, object-oriented and generic programming language.
Unlike C#, C++ is designed primary for systems programming like embedded systems and kernels.

3.PHP
PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development, although 
it is also used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP code can be simply mixed with 
HTML code. It is usually processed by a PHP interpreter.

4.JavaScript
JavaScript is a dynamic scripting computer programming language with dynamic typing. It is 
most commonly used as part of web browsers but also in server-side network programming, 
game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications.

5.Objective-C
Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. It adds Smalltalk-style 
messaging to the C programming language. Objective-C is the main programming language 
used for the OS X and iOS development.

6.Python
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It emphasizes code readability, 
and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than other languages.
